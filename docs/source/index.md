**Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD)** - bias metric with linear sample complexity  
*...with a MILP formulation that also tells you **which subgroup is most affected**.*

## Quick install & 60-second demo

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/humancompatible/detect.git
```

```python
from humancompatible.detect import detect_bias_csv

msd_val, rule = detect_bias_csv(
    csv_path="census.csv",                  # any CSV file
    target_col="income_50k",                # binary target
    protected_list=["race", "age"],         # columns to audit
    method="MSD",                           # chosen method
)

print(f"MSD = {msd_val:.3f}", "Rule ->", rule) 
```

The function returns

- **`msd_val`** – the maximum gap (in percentage‐points) between any subgroup and its complement  
- **`rule`** – the raw subgroup encoding as a list of `(feature_index, Bin)` pairs.  
  To get a human‐readable description, do the following:

  ```python
  pretty = " AND ".join(str(cond) for _, cond in rule)
  print("Subgroup:", pretty)
  # -> "Subgroup: Race = Blue AND Age = 0-18"
  ```

## MSD as a distance?
Bias detection can be understood as measuring some distance between two distributions (positive X negative samples, some training dataset X general population data...).

However, most distances have exponential sample complexity, whereas MSD requires a linear number of samples (w.r.t. the dimension) to achieve the same error.

| Classical metric               | Needs full d‐dim joint? | Sample cost | Drawbacks                                        |
|-------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| Wasserstein, TV, MMD, …        | yes                     | Ω(2^d)      | exponential samples, no subgroup info           |
| **MSD (ours)**              | only protected attrs    | O(d)        | ✓ returns exact subgroup & gap                  |

MSD maximises the absolute difference in probability over all protected‐attribute combinations (subgroups), yet is solvable in practice through an exact Mixed‐Integer optimization that scans the doubly‐exponential space effectively.
